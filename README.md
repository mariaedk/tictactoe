  - In this example's case, it has been downloaded on "Downloads". Open your terminal, and go to the directory which contains the folder by typing:
  
    `cd downloads` 
    
    - please note that you must press "enter" after typing every command.
  - After that, we must open the folder "tictactoe-main":
     
    `cd tictactoe-main`
    
  - Done that, type:

     `cd trabalho-final`
     
  - Now we must generate classes, we can make that by a simple command:
  
      `javac JogoDaVelha.java`
      
  - And then finally to play the game: 
  
      `java JogoDaVelha`
      
 - And... Enjoy the game ! :)
